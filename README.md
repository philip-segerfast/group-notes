# Group Notes

A fullstack application where users can share notes within groups, family or privately.
Similar to Google Docs but simpler and with live typing (multiple people can edit the notes at the same time).

Backend framework is Spring Boot (with Java) and Frontend is Kotlin Multiplatform (although only Android is currently supported).
